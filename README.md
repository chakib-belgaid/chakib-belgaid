At the moment, I'm investigating how much **energy** programming languages consume. I provide tools to measure the energy usage of a software, a function, or just a few lines of code.

**GREEN CODING** is my signature 

I'm passionate about data visualization and software insights. I'm attempting to give a set of indicators and KPIs to assist developers in increasing the performance of their code while decreasing its energy usage.
