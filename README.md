Iâ€™m currently working on **energy consumption** of *programming languages* 
I develop tools to measure the energy consumption of a program, a function or just some blocks of code 

**GREEN CODING** is my signature 

I'm currently learning *statistics* *data visualisation* and *machine learning*
and in my free time i try new frameworks ( right now i'm into flutter ğŸ˜„ )
